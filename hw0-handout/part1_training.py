""" Implement this script so that
    ```
    uv run part1_training.py
    ```
    will train a DNN on a *rotated* MNIST dataset.

    You could use the following code to create a model:
    ```
    from helpers import Model
    model = Model()
    ```
    and use the following code to save the trained model parameters:
    ```
    model.save('artifacts/model.pt')
    ```

    See README.md for the requirements.
